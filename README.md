Flyover is a Python library for extracting metadata from your data sources and generating structured Markdown files from it. It's a companion library to Carte, a lightweight data catalog for fast moving data teams. Flyover currently supports the AWS Glue catalog but more sources are coming.

The files generated by Flyover can be fed into Carte as-is to get a statically generated data catalog.

## Installation

``` sh
pip install carte-flyover
```

## Usage

Flyover uses the Boto3 library to fetch the Glue catalog. This means you need an AWS CLI profile defined that can access the required databases and tables.
