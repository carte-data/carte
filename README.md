Carte is a Python library for extracting metadata from your data sources and generating structured Markdown files from it. It's a companion library to the Carte front end, a lightweight data catalog for fast moving data teams. Carte currently supports the AWS Glue catalog and PostgreSQL but more sources are coming.

The files generated by Carte can be fed into the front end as-is to get a statically generated data catalog.

## Installation

``` sh
pip install carte-cli
```

If you plan to use PostgreSQL as a data source, you should also install the related optional dependencies using the following command instead of the first one:

``` sh
pip install carte-cli[postgres]
```



## Usage

See [the docs](https://docs.cartedata.com)
